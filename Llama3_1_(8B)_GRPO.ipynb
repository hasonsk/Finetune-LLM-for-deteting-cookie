Purposes of using cookies The processing of cookies helps us to personalize the User's settings based on his previous and current activity on the Site, as well as to improve the efficiency of the Site and the security of its use. Types of cookies we use We use two types of cookies: (1) basic cookies, the processing of which is necessary and without which the functionality of our Site for Users would be limited, for example: information about the IP address, date and time of use, volume of transferred data, browser and language settings, version of browser software and operating system, etc. (2) additional cookies related to the experience of using the Site, which are used for analysis of the Site and for marketing purposes. Consent to the use of cookies We do not request separate consent from the User for the use of basic cookies. To use additional cookies, we need the prior consent of the User. Accordingly, during the first visit to the Site, a banner will appear on the screen of the User's device asking him to give us his consent to the use of additional cookies. If such consent has already been given, the banner will not appear again until it is withdrawn or until the Company stops using cookies.

Google Analytics Our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that tracks, processes and sends us information about how the Site is used to help us improve it. In this way, Google Analytics analyzes your use of the Site for us. Google Analytics performs analysis by placing cookies on your device. The information collected by cookies includes the number of visitors to the Site, the pages they visit and the length of time the visitor spends on the Site. The specified data is systematized, therefore, ultimately, it is anonymous. You can withdraw your consent to the use of Google Analytics at any time.
